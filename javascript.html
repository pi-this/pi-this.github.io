    <h2>Alert</h2>
    <pre>alert() in any line
    on javascript (js) to make a 
    pop up appear inluding that text.
    If alert("hello") was
    typed then a pop up window would 
    pop up including a word
    saying hello. The window
    would also include one 
    button, this button says okay.

    <h2>Prompt</h2>
    <pre>prompt() in any
    line on javascript (js) to make 
    a pop up appear inluding
    that text, while listening for an awnser.
    If prompt("name?") 
    was typed then a 
    pop up window would 
    pop up including
    a word saying name?.
    The window would also
    include two buttons,
    one to cancel and one to 
    give an okay responce.
    prompt is way different 
    then alert because it asks a
    question, while alert only tells.

    <h2>Confirm</h2>
    <pre>confirm() in
    any line on javascript (js) to make 
    a pop up appear inluding 
    that text, it is much like the 
    alert, however it has 
    two buttons, not one.
    If prompt("hi") was 
    typed then a pop up 
    window would pop 
    up including a word 
    saying hi. The window
    would also include two 
    buttons, one to cancel and one 
    to give an okay responce. 
    confirm is way different 
    then alert because it shows two
    buttons, while alert only 
    shows one, the okay button
