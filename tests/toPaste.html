      <h2>What is Pi-this?</h2>
      <p>My username on GitHub is Pi-this. I've used it to create a GitHub page site with the same name - pi-this.github.io. On this site, you can find all my repositories and projects. I share information related to my interests, which include computer science, math, STEM, and STEAM. Although I cannot include everything, I try to add more information to the website with each new version. 

        The latest version, 2.0, features a new colorful CSS style and loads more information and activities. I've also added a user profile that includes pi-coins, a play currency that you can use to purchase items. All the data is saved to your computer, locally. 
        
        In summary, pi-this is my GitHub username, which I use to create fun projects and ideas. And pi-this.github.io is the website where I share information related to STEM and STEAM, GitHub repositories, fun games and ideas, and anything related to the word pi!</p>
      
      <h2>Why Pi-this?</h2>
      <p>Pi is an infinite decimal that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. I find pi fascinating, not only as a number but also as a symbol of endlessness. The website "pi-this" highlights the boundless nature of creativity, which is why I chose to use the word pi. If pi can represent endlessness, then creativity can also be described using the word pi. I even coined terms like "pi-this," "pi-that," and "pi-coins" just for fun. Anything on the site can have "pi-" added to the beginning. After all, pi is the limit!</p>
