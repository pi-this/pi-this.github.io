## Comming Soon To Pi-this.github.io


Pi-this.github.io version 2 is currently under development. The new version of the pi-this website will allow users to save data to their local host. This data will include pi-coins which can be used to purchase items from the pi-this shop. Since pi-coins will be saved locally, users will be able to give themselves 500 pi-coins easily by accessing the developer options and setting pi-coins to 500. In addition, a tutorial on how to obtain infinite pi-coins will be available on this GitHub page. This new feature will be heavily emphasized in the latest update. 

The new update will also feature a playful and colorful design, with new styles and enhanced graphics. Furthermore, the new version will be checked for grammar and spelling mistakes using Grammarly. Keep an eye out for the release of pi-this GitHub site 2.0!
