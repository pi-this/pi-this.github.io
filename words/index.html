        <p>
            According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art">merriam-webster.com</a>, art is a form of expression that demands a high level of proficiency and craftsmanship. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-definition-of-art-182707#:~:text=Art%20is%20a%20human%20activity%20consisting%20in%20this%2C,earliest%20symbolic%20scribblings%20of%20mankind%20to%20be%20art.">Thoughtco.com</a> says the definition of art has changed over time and culture, from being a skillful practice to expressing originality and creativity. In Western culture, art was once seen as a craft that required knowledge and practice, especially during the Dutch Golden Age. Later, art became more about beauty, emotion, and spirituality, as seen in the Romantic period. Finally, art became more experimental and innovative, as exemplified by the Avant-garde and modern art movements.

        <h1>Binary</h1>
        <p>We usually count in a base-ten number system, which means we use ten digits (0 to 9) to represent any number. Binary is a base-two number system that is made up of only two digits: 1 and 0. Computers use this as their core language to communicate. A 1 to a computer means power on, while a 0 means power off. The more variety and combinations that these digits have, the more instructions they can give to the computer.

        <h1>Bug</h1>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bugs-in-software-testing/">geeksforgeeks.org</a>, software bugs are flaws or defects that make software or systems malfunction and behave differently from their intended behavior. They can be caused by various factors, but two common ones are poor communication and changing requirements. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and confusion about what the software should do and how it should do it. Changing requirements can create chaos and pressure for software developers and testers, as they have to modify or add features that can affect other parts of the software. These factors can result in discrepancies, inconsistencies, and software failures.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/central-processing-unit-cpu/">geeksforgeeks.org</a>, a CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brain of a computer that performs data input/output, processing, and storage functions. It is made of silicon and can be installed into a socket on the motherboard. The history of the CPU dates back to 1823, when silicon was discovered, and includes many milestones such as the invention of the transistor, the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the dual-core processor. Some of the major companies that have developed CPUs are Intel, Motorola, Sun, and AMD. CPUs have evolved to become faster, smaller, and more powerful.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp">w3schools.com</a>, CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a way of interacting with computers by typing text commands. CLI was the only way to use computers in the 1960s and was widely used by Unix and DOS systems in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, most users prefer graphical user interfaces (GUI), but CLI is still useful for software developers and system administrators. CLI commands can perform various tasks, such as copying, moving, deleting, or creating files and folders, or installing software. CLI commands vary depending on the operating system and can be learned by using the help command.

        <h1>Data</h1>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/">geeksforgeeks.com</a>, computer data refers to information that can be measured, collected, analyzed, and visualized, and it can originate from various sources and in different forms. The significance of computer data lies in its ability to facilitate better decision-making, problem-solving, process improvement, and understanding of customers and markets. Categorical data, which has predefined categories, and numerical data, which comprises discrete or continuous numerical values, are the two primary classifications of computer data. Furthermore, computer data can be classified into four scales, namely nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio, based on the level of measurement and the presence of a true zero point. </p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/e-eulers-number.html">mathsisfun.com</a>, the number e is an irrational number that is the base of natural logarithms and appears in many areas of mathematics. It is often called Euler’s number and its first few digits are 2.718281828459045. There are many ways to calculate e, but none of them give an exact answer because e has infinite non-repeating digits. One way is to use the formula (1 + 1/n)n as n gets very large, and another way is to use the sum of the reciprocals of factorials. To remember e, you can use a mnemonic sentence or notice the pattern of 1828 twice and the angles of a right triangle.</p>

When a client (browser) sends a request to a server, it waits for a response that may contain the requested web page, a redirection to another page, or an error message. HTTP is stateless, which means it does not retain any information between requests. Most of the time we don't even see HTTP on a web link, instead we see HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which is a more secure extension of HTTP.</p>

      <h1>Pi</h1>     
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/pi.html">mathsisfun.com</a>, pi is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number that has no exact decimal representation and no pattern in its digits. Pi is defined as the circumference divided by the diameter of any circle, and it is always the same value, approximately 3.14159. Pi can be used to find the circumference or diameter of a circle when one of them is known, using the formulas C = πD and D = C/π. Pi can also be approximated by fractions such as 22/7 or 355/113, which are close but not equal to pi. Pi has many digits that go on forever without repeating, and some people use mnemonics or special methods to remember them. Pi Day is a celebration of pi that occurs on March 14, which looks like 3/14, the first three digits of pi.</p>

So, does this have to do with the number pi as in 3.14...? Not really. The founder of the Raspberry Pi did not specifically say that the word "Pi" relates to the number. It was said that the word is related to the programming language Python.

"The raspberry" mentioned earlier was not an actual fruit but rather a reference to Raspberry Pi - a small computer that can fit in your pocket and budget. This personal mini-computer was created to help young minds learn how to make and program computers. The name Raspberry Pi was inspired by the trend of electronic companies using food names as their brand names, similar to Apple, Acorn, Apricot, Orange Micro Inc., and Tangerine.
